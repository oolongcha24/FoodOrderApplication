# FoodOrderApplication
A food order simulator application was developed using Java with JavaFX GUI and NetBean IDE 8.2

This application consists of 2 types of users: (Owner and Customer).
The owner's username and password are: "admin". Owner can control the food list and the customer's information, where he can choose to add or remove dishes and the customer's login info.
Customers have access to the dishes list and purchase as needed. There is also a redeeming feature added to this application. Customers could gain redeem points from purchasing food and use them to buy food.

Future updates: I'm planning to add the feature where the customers can modify their personal information such as name, age, gender, and address.
